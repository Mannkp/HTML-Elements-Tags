    <h1>&lt;i&gt;: The Idiomatic Text element</h1>
    <p>The &lt;i&gt; HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the &lt;i&gt; naming of this element.<br>
    <p>I looked at it and thought <i>This can't be real!</i></p>
    <p><i lang="la">Musa</i> is one of two or three genera in the family <i lang="la">Musaceae</i>; it includes bananas and plantains.</p>
    <p>The term <i>bandwidth</i> describes the measure of how much information can pass through a data connection in a given amount of time.</p>
